              Hi, I'm Brady. I'm a Milwaukee-based backend and data engineer at
              eQual.us. At eQual, I work with a wonderful, small team to deliver
              data that drives core campaign decisions for progressive ballot
              initiatives. I lead our tech team to extend our
              AWS-Laravel-React.js-built SaaS products and develop our data
              platform in service of client reporting. Previously, I worked at
              IBM as a cloud data engineer in Enterprise Performance Management.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m mainly not a computer person though. I love to cook, play
              music with friends, keep up with the news, and worry about things.
              Beyond doing work that is challenging and interesting technically,
              I love bringing my skills to equity-focused non-profits and public
              programs with technology needs.
