              Hey, nice to meet you. I’m Brady. I’m a cloud data engineer at
              IBM. My team there manages a data pipeline and an interface for
              controlling that pipeline. I regularly develop new UI features,
              ingest data from multidimensional data sources using complex jobs
              configured by our UI, manage Kubernetes pods and create docker
              images to build these pods. Most recently, I’ve redesigned our
              product’s UI with mockups and am in the process of implementing
              it. We are removing much of the existing legacy code for a
              simpler, more consistent design and information hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m mainly not a computer person though. I love to cook, play
              music with friends, keep up with the news, and worry about things.
              Beyond doing work that is challenging and interesting technically,
              I hope to do work that I also feel deeply connected to, to take
              these technical skills and bring them to equity-focused
              non-profits and public programs with technology needs.
